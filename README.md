### About the permissions

We do *not* collect any personal information or data you store within Axle.

ðŸ”’Replace the page you see when opening a new tab
* This is why you installed this extension, right? :)

ðŸ”’Read your browsing history
* This is required to fetch information about the tabs you have currently open, so you can add bookmarks directly from the new tab page.
	* How is this related to browsing history? Being able to see which tabs you have open means we can theoretically save all of your tab information all the time, so we could theoretically record your browsing history. But rest assured, we don't!
